Cybersecurity industry was facing workforce shortages, yet attacker''s methods kept evolving. A smart group of ex-IBM researchers thought they had the silver bullet to address advanced cyber threats with graph-based AI.

The catch? Make people believe your claim and vote with their wallet.

As the founding and lead product designer, I launched the cybersecurity web dashboard from scratch. I wore multiple hats, from interviewing customers, crafting UI & a design systems, writing APIs to implementing CSS.

I also filled the gap of a product owner by translating customer insights into actionable product features, prioritized the backlog and envisioned the roadmap - something I ended up enjoyed quite a lot.

The company partnered up with a national bank to incubate the product with real customer data. This also provided the golden opportunity for me to be up and personal with potential users.

One of the first thing I did was to sit down with different people in the open office and chat about what they do, their goals, motivations and struggles. Based on the conversations and observations, I created two key personas.

Some low-hanging fruits emerged from this research:
- Junior operators spend a lot of time using a paper manual to understand data points in the database, which could be easily digitized and embedded in the dashboard to increase their efficiency and accuracy.
- Everyday, the senior analysts assigned a list of high-priority targets for junior operators to scan through, this process mirrored how our algorithms works, so we codified this workflow in the dashboard.
Combining those insights with knowledge of competitor products, I sketched out various concepts to help the team understand different feature's purposes, value-adds and technical scopes.

Then I hosted prioritization workshops with the product team and engineer stakeholder (CTO) to determine each feature's technical feasibility and customer impact.

I learnt early in my career that clear roadmap sand feature requirements might not always be available to you. But with deep knowledge of customer needs, and forming partnership with business and engineers gave me more than enough confidence to design solutions.

Through the prioritization exercise, our team found an elephant in the room: how do we convince experienced cybersecurity practitioners to trust our A.I.'s predictions? After all, this is a field with notoriously low tolerance for error, that even 0.1% inaccuracy has large financial and operational impacts.

Initially, I sought scientific explanations of the various underlying A.I. models from our in-house data scientists. BI ran into a dead end: cracking the A.I. blackbox is a billion-dollar question that the top minds around the world haven't cracked yet. I needed to find another way.

And customer empathy to the rescue! Through mapping out the workflow of how experienced cybersecurity practitioners validate their hypothesis, I learnt that many of the "symptoms" they are looking for, such as if a device operated at an abnormal schedule, or if it is trying to access sensitive information - this data was required to train the ML models and thus already being collected, cleaned and formatted, and we could use it to "playback the crime scene", and let human be the judge. A.I. simply needs to point towards the suspects.

This is still a bold idea, and added stress to our front-end implementation and delivery timeline. But I was able to get enough buy-ins to try a small experiment: in a week I partnered with a front-end engineer to build a functional prototype, and demonstrated the use case with orchestrated test data.

Until then, senior, more technical proficient analysts cared little about our tinkering, they are always interested in their good-old programming skills. But the new forensic tool immediately got their attention.

It is not a surprise that data geeks love data visualizations. It was still a bit flattering to finally be able to pique their interests, and that's a sign that our solution started to address the core of their considerations.

Visual polish and consistency - those tiny details play a big role in earning customer's trust. I needed to create a visual identity and design system that fits in the scope of a "brick & mortar" front-end team, yet be inclusive of significant amount of data visualization elements. Taking inspiration from the font "IBM Plex Sans", I extended the geometric element of the typography into elements of the charts and the UIs.

The old-school look is a modern take on the DOS system that many cybersecurity analysts use and prefer.

<Col_2_Section title='Impact'>
- Over 9 months, I shipped a complex dashboard with my team from scratch
- I introduced customer-centric development to the team and was able to identify small and large opportunities that directly address business results
- I simplified the screening process from 5 steps and 4 tools into 1 screen on 1 platform
- I pitched a novel solution to address A.I. interpretability and trust, and gained buy-ins from team to conduct a small-scoped experiment to validate the concept
- My team secured its first paying customer and a $2 million contract, and was well-positioned to scale the product further
