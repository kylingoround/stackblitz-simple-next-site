"Clutter is nothing more than postponed decisions."
- Barbara Hemphill

<Col_2_Section title='Introduction'>
Extraspace Storage is the No.2 largest storage provider in the U.S.. It prides itself for its friendly stuffs and clean, well-equipped storage spaces, but before covid, its website was out-dated, and suffered from long booking time, high user churn and poor usability.

Post-Covid, ESS relies on its online portal to bring in customers and become the first touchpoint to engage with their brand. It teamed up with Method Inc, a New York-based design agency to level up its online retail experience to match its excellent in-person experience.

In 12 Weeks, I led the UX research, A/B testing and design-system-implementation and recommended a solution to mediate between business metrics and user-oriented goals. I worked with a design director, another designer alongside ESS's cross-functional team of business, engineering, marketing and branding stakeholders.

How do you approach a complete redesign? While there was some data such as heat map or conversion rate, the data did not inform us the cause of the symptoms. Heuristic evaluation allowed me to systematically exam all the UX & issues without bias.

I later reviewed the findings with my team, and together we grouped the issues into buckets. Some of the issues we identified were:
- Visual Clutter:  Unhelpful information cluttered the space and got in the way for user to scan for relevant, helpful information.
- Inconsistent UIs: Search bars could have 3 different appearances depending on where users are at, contributed to disoriented navigation, long use sessions and user churn.

<Col_2_Section title='Balance User Needs and Revenue-optimization'>
Another UX issue identified was how convoluted the process was for searching and booking. Through conversation was a SEO-specialist, I started to understand how some of the UI inconsistency and visual clutter came to be: information and page was optimised to include content that could drive website's ranking and customer funnel.

Inspired by adjacent competitors such as AirBnB and WeWork and innovators in the storage space, I designed two approaches:
- Utilitarian Approach: Offers the quickest route to booking, with clear CTAs for knowledge centers and information helpers.
- Conversational Approach: A 3-step wizard to walk the customer through the basic filtering questions to pick storage of the right size, type and properties.

![Conversational Approach](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713936696/ExstraSpace/ess_conversational_approach_qgu0wr.png)

Then we tested the success rate, speed and sentiment on user-testing.com. I helped crafted the test flow and prepared a functional prototype in Figma with the research team.  The conversational, self-guided approach received more favourable results.

“I don't feel like I would really have to worry about calling anybody.
Almost everything I can think that I would need, I can find it here.”
‍-- A/B Testers on Usertesting.com

One interesting unexpected discovery: less people used the “call” CTA on mobile. Previously, based on statistics, the team hypothesized that mobile ESS users might prefer to use phone call to book orders, but if we recall our experiences booking on AirBnB or Expedia, we rarely called. This findings did not warrant to remove the sticky call CTA, but is a positive sign that our design was moving needle towards the right direction in providing a more usable and accessible ordering platform on mobile.

2 Weeks, 2 designers and over 15 page templates across mobile and desktop platform - that's the challenge my team was facing during the hand-off phase.

I needed to be strategical and sharp with the execution plan in order to meet the deadline.

I set up the project with design system in mind, building out grids, typography, accessible colours and modular UI components. Everything was linked by design tokens so I can minimize redoing UIs. This was also particularly help when brand designs or copy texts needed to be updated. I can iterate on the design and have an updated prototype for user-testing the next day.

<Col_2_Section title='Impact'>
- Advocated and executed a human-centric design strategy in a historically utilitarian industry. Design was positively received in user-testing and launched in 2022.
- Met all business and SEO requirements without comprising user experience. Identified, pitched and designed a organic search landing page that was initially
- Using modular design to simplify booking and searching flow from 7 steps into 3, reduced pages needed to be supported by over 40% while supporting more traffic points and edge cases.
- Created full-fledged design system to support rapid prototyping for internal UX team and branding team.
