<MDX_EmphaszieText>
Texas Capital Bank wanted to digitize its enterprise customer onboarding process and financial operator workflows. The previous process took weeks, was prone to error and regulatory risks. 

With a tight timeline, uncertain product vision and a new team, I built the onboarding process and a customer 360 dashboard to improve operator efficiency, reduce regulation risk and improve client onboarding time.

<Col_2_Section title='Juggling Two Projects at Once'>
- **Challenge**: Joining a new team, I needed to create a design roadmap and find time to unblock my team with customer research.
- **Approach**: I aligned with the product owner on goals, expecation and scopes, identified road blockers and leverages (an existing design system).
- **Setbacks**: Unclear product vision & lack of budget / access for user research process hindered my team's progress for the past 3 month.
- **Result**: I budgeted time for user research (recruiting, interview), leveraged the design system to quickly implemented an onboarding solution, and successfully unblocked my team and proposed a set of evidence-based product vision.

{/* <Col_2_Section title='Results'>

- I was able to leverage the design system to wrap-up the onboarding solution within a few weeks, leaving me ample time to explore the ambitious 360 Dashboard initiative.
- I was able to partner up with the product owner and production manager to defend the scope, keeping a sharp product focus while advocating for user values.
- I maintained and contributed to the design system, which helped me whip up the design concept quickly to effectively communicate my design and gain alignment on product vision.

<Col_2_Section title='Finding a Proxy for Customer Insights'>
- **Challenge**: Lack of access / budget for user research.
- **Approach**: Conducted proxy user research with financial analysts to develop a pseudo-persona, supplemented by competitor analysis.
- **Result**: Developed a provoking MVP that clarified the product vision and aligned with leadership, informed the product's vision & dashboard's core function.

**Dashboard Home**
The Dashboard home page was designed to present performance target, risk factor (loa/saving ratio) and help financial operators track recent application's review status. It also presents a search to tap into customer information easily.

**Performance Tab**
The Performance tab presented key statistics of different business lines. It was designed to be modular and flexible, and each graph could be swapped out on the fly based on stakeholder & user feedback.

The evidence-based, high-fidelity interactive MVP successfully provoked the product owner and tech executive for a clear product vision, and I flashed out the rest of the dashboard features within 3 weeks for potential user validation.

{/* <Col_2_Section title='Solution 2'>
**Drilldown Chart Customization**
One feedback my team received was to provide a drill-down view of the Business-Line chart, and explore how to customize the drill-down view to reflect user's different priority based on each business line.

{/* <MDX_P>
Customization feature can be expansive to build because it requires new UI components, new interaction patterns. I needed to balance the scope and feasibility of the customization feature, navigate around ambiguity and design for stakeholder alignment & future user validation.
</MDX_P> */}

{/* <Col_2_Section title='Solution 2'>
**Drilldown Chart Customization**
I sketched out a drag-n-drop approach and a “customization toggle” approach. The layout's complexity didn't need to warrant a drag-n-drop interfaceCustomization Toggle can better support the comparison view and can better utilize I paid extra attention on usability to communicate the mode change while complying with the existing design system guidelines.

Based on best practices and existing design system components, I built the drill-down and customization flow to support future user validation and to align with stakeholders.

{/* Based on the trade-off, I aligned with my team that the Toggle option (option B) better suited the user context and development goals here. I added this to the figma prototype. */}

Expanding the Design System to support Rapid Prototyping
Since the product's vision was unclear, I leveraged the design system to build a high-fidelity prototype to help clarify the product's features & delivered customer value, and effectively gained stakeholder alignment. It is also a handy artifact for user validation in the future. I focused on:
- Consistency: Ensuring typography and color consistency comply with existing components.
- Scalability: easy to add new chart to the dashboard and drill-down view in the future
- Componentized Charts: since this MVP was made for vision alignment and rapid iteration, build out charts in components can help with rapid iteration based on feedback
</Col_2_Section> */}

<Col_2_Section title='Balancing Customization Features Against Feasibility'>
- **Challenge**: Designing a customizable drill-down view for business line charts that balances scalability, speed and quality.
- **Approach**: Explored simple customization toggles as well as complex drag-and-drop solutions, prioritized based on implementation cost, user value and product value.
- **Result**: Chose the toggle approach that met product owner's requirement, extensible for future product requirements and set up for speedy usability/functionality validation.

![Design System Showcase](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713829916/TCP/TCP_DS_tulaf9.jpg)

{/* <Col_2_Section title='Impact'>

- I successfully unblocked my team's progress with proxy and competitive research
- Based on defined audience's duty, goals and frustrations, I narrowed down the project feature and scope, and aligned with product & executive stakeholders
- I proposed new data visualization components to the design system. Leveraged the design system to rapidly create a high-fidelity dashboard prototype for better stakeholder feedback, alignment and future user validation.
- I was able to wrap up the early-discovery in 3 weeks, gained the trust of the principle product strategist, and effectively aligned with key executives on a unified vision.

Caveat:
I moved onto another project after the early-discovery phase due to staffing, however I explored in-depth how I conduct follow-up user validation to quantify the design solution in the Marketplace case study.

<Col_2_Section title='Summary'>
This experience at Texas Capital Bank showcased my ability to rapidly adapt to new environments and deliver impactful design solutions that meet both user needs and business objectives. My key contributions included leveraging design systems for quick execution, conducting insightful proxy research, and aligning product visions with stakeholder expectations.

<MDX_P>
Moving forward, I would seek even earlier alignment on project goals and user access, potentially improving the scope definition and reducing reliance on proxy data. Enhancing direct user engagement and iterative validation could further refine our solutions and ensure they more closely meet user expectations.

If I have more time:
- **User Validation**: I would love to seek first or second-hand user validation related to the dashboard & onboarding's flow.
- **AI Augmentation**: I would love to exaime and quantify the current financial operator's workflow and efficiency, and find further optimization opporutinies leveraging genAI, such as document OCR and regulatory AI assistant, to further the project's goal to increase operator efficiency and reduce regulatory risks.
