 title="Introduction"
first="Texas Capital Bank wanted to digitize its enterprise-client-facing operations, to reduce errors, mitigate legal & compliance risks and improve financial operator efficiency.">
I needed to juggle between two projects while ramping up quickly in a new team, deliver high quality UI for an Enterprise Onboarding Solution, unblock my team's progress with a Customer 360 Dashboard exploration which has its progress stagnated due to lack of clear product vision & customer insights, and built trustful partnership with my (new) cross-functional partners to iterate solutions that balance usability & development velocity.

<Col_2_Section title='Juggling Two Projects at Once'>
I worked with the product strategist to understand the project scope and goals, and identify blockers, dependencies and what resources I can leverage to help increase my design velocity
I found out that the previous designer has built a solid design system foundation that allow me to quickly create and iterate onboarding’s form-filling applications to satisfy usability & compliance requirements.
I also learnt that the second initiative ---- a 0-to-1 Customer 360 Dashboard exploration was delayed due to lack of access to the target user, so I started to recruit experts with similar backgrounds for proxy research.
I created an interactive Figma prototype that demonstrated the onboarding flow with TCP's risk & compliance stakeholders to invite iteration feedback
I partnered with the product owner to diligently defend the scope while maintaining a healthy relationship with stakeholders.

<Col_2_Section title='Results'>

- I was able to leverage the design system to wrap-up the onboarding solution within a few weeks, leaving me ample time to explore the ambitious 360 Dashboard initiative.
- I was able to partner up with the product owner and production manager to defend the scope, keeping a sharp product focus while advocating for user values.
- I maintained and contributed to the design system, which helped me whip up the design concept quickly to effectively communicate my design and gain alignment on product vision.

<Col_2_Section title='Finding a Proxy for Customer Insights'>
TCP wanted to explore an ambitious Customer 360 Dashboard that takes one-step further of its digital transformation, but it lacks clear direction, and due to internal policy, Method team couldn't get direct interview access or data related to the target users.

- I aligned with the product strategist on a provocative strategy that might better stimulate a response from the leadership.
- I conducted proxy user research with an experienced financial analyst of another national bank to create a pseudo-persona that provides evidence-based user goals, motivations and key objectives.
- Combined with competitor research, I built out the first MVP prototype in order to more faithfully deliver our hypothesis of the product vision, leveraging the design system.

Caveat: It is important not to confuse proxy research as a replacement of true customer insights, hence the importance of validation, but this research as well as competitor research does provide valuable insights on what problems people are solving in a specific industry.

**Dashboard Home**
The Dashboard home page was designed to present performance target, risk factor (loa/saving ratio) and help financial operators track recent application’s review status. It also presents a search to tap into customer information easily.

**Performance Tab**
The Performance tab presented key statistics of different business lines. It was designed to be modular and flexible, and each graph could be swapped out on the fly based on stakeholder & user feedback.

(description) The evidence-based, high-fidelity interactive MVP successfully provoked the product owner and tech executive for a clear product vision, and I flashed out the rest of the dashboard features within 3 weeks for potential user validation.

<Col_2_Section title='Solution 2'>
**Drilldown Chart Customization**
One feedback my team received was to provide a drill-down view of the Business-Line chart, and explore how to customize the drill-down view to reflect user's different priority based on each business line.

Customization feature can be expansive to build because it requires new UI components, new interaction patterns. I needed to balance the scope and feasibility of the customization feature, navigate around ambiguity and design for stakeholder alignment & future user validation.

<Col_2_Section title='Solution 2'>
**Drilldown Chart Customization**
I sketched out a drag-n-drop approach and a “customization toggle” approach. The layout’s complexity didn’t need to warrant a drag-n-drop interfaceCustomization Toggle can better support the comparison view and can better utilize I paid extra attention on usability to communicate the mode change while complying with the existing design system guidelines.

Based on best practices and existing design system components, I built the drill-down and customization flow to support future user validation and to align with stakeholders.
</Col_2_Section>

<ImageWithCaption alt="alt text" src="/placeholderPNG.png">
  Based on the trade-off, I aligned with my team that the Toggle option (option
  B) better suited the user context and development goals here. I added this to
  the figma prototype.

Expanding the Design System to support Rapid Prototyping

Since the product's vision was unclear, I leveraged the design system to build a high-fidelity prototype to help clarify the product's features & delivered customer value, and effectively gained stakeholder alignment. It is also a handy artifact for user validation in the future. I focused on:

- Consistency: Ensuring typography and color consistency comply with existing components.
- Scalability: easy to add new chart to the dashboard and drill-down view in the future
- Componentized Charts: since this MVP was made for vision alignment and rapid iteration, build out charts in components can help with rapid iteration based on feedback

<Col_2_Section title='Impact'>

- I successfully unblocked my team's progress with proxy and competitive research
- Based on defined audience's duty, goals and frustrations, I narrowed down the project feature and scope, and aligned with product & executive stakeholders
- I proposed new data visualization components to the design system. Leveraged the design system to rapidly create a high-fidelity dashboard prototype for better stakeholder feedback, alignment and future user validation.
- I was able to wrap up the early-discovery in 3 weeks, gained the trust of the principle product strategist, and effectively aligned with key executives on a unified vision.

Caveat:
I moved onto another project after the early-discovery phase due to staffing, however I explored in-depth how I conduct follow-up user validation to quantify the design solution in the Marketplace case study.
