"The beauty of games is that they are a voluntary attempt
to overcome unnecessary obstacles."

<Col_2_Section title='Introduction'>
Today's game publishers rely more and more on live games that keep players interested with constant updates and in-game cosmetics, and customer support plays a crucial role in keeping players engaged. Method partnered with a leading game maker and publisher, to reimagine its customer support services.

Over 10 weeks, our team of 3 designers and 1 product manager worked with over 10 support teams from technology, marketing to customer service to map out the current player experience; create a cohesive vision for the experience; and built a production-ready design for the new web portal.

Player Painpoints Surfacedin the Support Journey

<Col_2_Section title="Mapping Out Player's Journey to Support">
The client's support has a complex game portfolio and each game needs to be supported differently, from being locked out of the account to handle game-crashing bugs. Through stakeholder interviews, competitor research and collaboration with internal data and behavior analysts, we were able to map out the most common support issues (represented in red squares) unto the customer experience.

This journey map does not directly address how players seek out support. We used this artifact to shift each team's focus from their responsible products to a unified player experience, where each support issue is rarely encountered but can permanently damage the experience if not supported.

Each support issue is also a starting point to a help journey, mapping out the decision-making and touch-point encountered in a player's journey to seek help. We closely examined roadblocks and pain points in each help journey and made comparisons with external alternatives such as google search and online forums to indicate areas of improvement.
We want to know if there is a quick fix to our problem,
If the solution doesn't work, I want to find ways to talk to someone (who is smarter than a machine),
I want to receive updates that my needs are addressed or if follow-ups are needed.

<Col_2_Section title='One Unified Support Strategy'>
With over 200 types of support questions asked on the website, ranging from technical issues to in-game problems, we needed a unified framework for Ubisoft's support department. This framework allows everyone, regardless of their role, to contribute to a consistent customer experience. Therefore, we created a service pattern to help different teams achieve a unified service experience:
- Assist on the sport: Proactively assist players at the point of issue by embedding help knowledge in relevant touchpoints, such as checkout pages, error messages, or in-game guides.
- Always a clear path to Escalate: Ensure players can easily find clear escalation paths, whether to a human agent, chatbot, or the support website, when an error occurs.
- Update progress consistently: Provide timely follow-ups on support tickets or inquiries to demonstrate Ubisoft's accountability and build trust with players.

<Col_2_Section title='Designing the web portal'>
The web portal is where the customer support team serves relevant help knowledge, primarily in the form of support articles.

The architecture used to be centered around the search bar. This is problematic because the site lacks ways for users to scan the types of help that are available, and it requires a lot of effort and deep knowledge of customer support to frame someone's question precisely.

![Information Architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713838401/Ubisoft/Ubisoft_IA_hcrqyi.png)

The new IA provides two entry points that help users identify their problem: through a high-level support category or through selecting a specific game. We also worked closely with the data and engineer team to brainstorm how to leverage user data, such as purchase history, game progression and crash reports, to promote relevant assistive information that might further reduce user's search effort.

Community and feedback also played a crucial role. Through stakeholder interviews, we learned that sometimes the community might be more responsive and knowledgeable on topics such as game knowledge or technical troubleshooting than the customer representatives. We envisioned a solution that integrates the support forum into support articles, so a player might engage the community directly if the official solution does not hit the mark, or if the player has something to contribute to a matter.

<Col_2_Section title='Impact'>
Our client's stakeholders were impressed by our team's ability to digest complex contexts of their workflow and team structure. Our design artifacts were well-received.

The biggest challenge was to promote a unified design vision throughout the organization. Through constant communication and co-creation of design artifacts and principles, we were able to align stakeholders from different groups. Plus it is always a good sign to hear people's excitement about their work ahead.

If there is more time, I would love to develop some data metrics to monitor the web portal's experience and to look further on how we can empower the gaming community to help themselves.
