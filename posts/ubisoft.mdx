<MDX_EmphaszieText>
Ubisoft aimed to overhaul its customer support services to increase player's time-in-game, increase issue coverage and increase the quality of support received. 

As part of Method and over 12 weeks, I mapped out the entire customer support experience over 5 product lanes, ideated and co-created over 12 solutions, and aligned with Ubisoft's top executives on both low-hanging-fruits and big bets.

Guided by a unified experience principle, Ubisoft launched the redesigned web portal in 2021 that serves millions of player across NA and EMEA.

<Col_2_Section title="Mapping Out the Player's Journey to Support">
- **Challenge**: The client's complex portfolio demanded different support strategies for each game, creating a fragmented player experience.
- **Design Approach**: Through stakeholder interviews and collaboration with analysts, we mapped out common issues and identified the touchpoints in the support journey where players sought help.
- **Unexpected Setbacks**: Internal teams were initially focused on individual products rather than a unified support strategy.
- **Result**: By focusing on a unified player experience, we identified areas of improvement and set a framework that aligned support teams toward a cohesive goal.

This journey map does not directly address how players seek out support. We used this artifact to shift each team's focus from their responsible products to a unified player experience, where each support issue is rarely encountered but can permanently damage the experience if not supported.

![Help Journey Zoom In](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713838408/Ubisoft/ubisoft_help_journey_moopuw.png)

Each support issue is also a starting point to a help journey, mapping out the decision-making and touch-point encountered in a player's journey to seek help. We closely examined roadblocks and pain points in each help journey and made comparisons with external alternatives such as google search and online forums to indicate areas of improvement.
We want to know if there is a quick fix to our problem,
If the solution doesn't work, I want to find ways to talk to someone (who is smarter than a machine),
I want to receive updates that my needs are addressed or if follow-ups are needed.

<Col_2_Section title='Designing a Unified Support Framework'>
- Challenge: The client's 200+ types of support queries required a consistent, user-friendly framework across all teams.
- Design Approach: We developed service patterns focused on assisting at the point of issue, providing clear escalation paths, and updating support progress consistently.
- Result: These patterns helped align support departments toward a consistent customer experience, enabling teams to proactively address issues at key touchpoints.

<Col_2_Section title='Redesigning the Web Portal'>
- Challenge: The previous web portal relied heavily on search functionality, which was cumbersome and required deep knowledge to use effectively.
- Design Approach: Our team introduced high-level support categories and specific game-based entry points. We collaborated with the data team to leverage purchase history, game progress, and crash reports to deliver relevant assistive information.
- Result: The portal architecture improved, providing a more intuitive and engaging user experience.

![Legacy Design vs. New Design](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713838416/Ubisoft/Ubisoft_comparision_b8xtso.png)

The architecture used to be centered around the search bar. This is problematic because the site lacks ways for users to scan the types of help that are available, and it requires a lot of effort and deep knowledge of customer support to frame someone's question precisely.

![Information Architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrdipypb/image/upload/v1713838401/Ubisoft/Ubisoft_IA_hcrqyi.png)

The new IA provides two entry points that help users identify their problem: through a high-level support category or through selecting a specific game. We also worked closely with the data and engineer team to brainstorm how to leverage user data, such as purchase history, game progression and crash reports, to promote relevant assistive information that might further reduce user's search effort.

Community and feedback also played a crucial role. Through stakeholder interviews, we learned that sometimes the community might be more responsive and knowledgeable on topics such as game knowledge or technical troubleshooting than the customer representatives. We envisioned a solution that integrates the support forum into support articles, so a player might engage the community directly if the official solution does not hit the mark, or if the player has something to contribute to a matter.

// Summary and Impact

### Reflection

Our collaborative and strategic approach impressed stakeholders, and the design artifacts were well received. By promoting a unified design vision and co-creating principles, we garnered enthusiasm for the future work. With more time, we would have loved to develop data metrics to monitor the web portal's impact and explore empowering the gaming community for self-help solutions.
