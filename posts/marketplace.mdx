“I feel forced to deal with [competitor product] and need to subscribe to several pattern software services. I already wear so many hats, I don’t want to waste time, money or feel constrained by my film / software providers.”
-  Auto Shop Owner

<Col_2_Section title='Introduction'>
The global paint protection film (think about it like raincoat for cars) market size is projected to grow from $559 million in 2023 to $853 million by 2030. 3M makes great films but was losing market share due to a lack of software features and insufficient film pattern collection for auto shop owners. 3M wanted to invest in a pattern marketplace to bolster its pattern collection with third-party pattern creators.

The catch? It's ambitious, bold and haven't been done before.

Pattern Creator Sentiment on
Incentive Program

Over 12 weeks, I led product and UI/UX design, customer research, and MVP design for thesis validation. Working with a product strategist, a production manager, and 3M's cross-functional teams, my team proposed a concrete, actionable plan to scale pattern production by 150%, and a well-received incentive program to attract third-party creators. I identified 3 key business personas and quantified how the new marketplace could add value to their business, with over 4.5/5 sentiment scores on proposed features.

Shop owners rely on digital cut programs and templates (unique to each car) to cut films, and those patterns film need to be utmost highest quality - otherwise shop owners risk not only wasting money on films, but valuable time that they could spend on other gigs, or worse, failing to deliver to their customer on-time.

Shop owners need high-quality digital patterns for cutting films, as poor-quality patterns can waste time and money. We discovered that creating these patterns requires years of skill, and finding freelance creators was challenging. They were like Jedi masters after the empire destroyed the Jedi order, nowhere to be found. This made customer research difficult without a clear definition of the customer.

How can we conduct customer research if we cannot find the customers? Even worse, when we didn't even have a definition of the customer?

Sometimes when you are stuck, it requires a change of perspective. So instead of asking where can we find “pattern creators”, I looked at the skills and experiences required and ask:

What it takes for someone to become a pattern creator, and where can we recruit / train them?

This focus on skills and responsibilities over titles gave my team the specificity we needed to recruit target customers. 7+ customer interviews later, we identified 2 sub-categories of pattern creators (one specializing in pattern quality validation to ensure quality) with another important revelation: many creators are shop owners themselves.

Understanding how rare the qualified, skillful pattern creators exist, and the amount of training and experiences required (they ARE like Jedis), plus their current occupations & motivation helped my team understand what incentives were needed to attract engagement.
The trick for efficient customer research is to be intentional and approach them with hypotheses and assumptions, so I can identify & fill my knowledge gaps as well as validating hypotheses in each customer interview, and build compound learnings.

My goal was to present my understanding of the marketplace to the strategist and 3M team. However, the challenge arose when the scope of the 6-week project doubled. With limited time, producing a high-quality service blueprint would be challenging.

On the other hand, service blueprints are time-consuming to build and can be intimidating for non-designers, often hindering discussions in cross-functional meetings. In contrast, a comic-like storyboard is more inviting and user-focused, highlighting what users do, say, look like, and their surroundings. This approach shifts the focus from systems to users, making it more effective for storytelling in a cross-functional context.

By presenting a storyboard instead of a blueprint, I was able to  shorten the time to wrap up a qualitative research, run more efficient alignment meetings with better engagement from engineers and business stakeholders. The simpler form also allowed me to iterate the process with new research findings.

The service blueprint still exists, it just exists in Miro in a low-fidelity format and consumed by designers and people with relevant contexts.

<Col_2_Section title='MVP Validation & Iteration'>
Based on the newfound knowledge of personas, their goals and pains, I created a prototype made of 3 main features:
- a Pattern Library that shop owner could search / filter patterns and read its reviews
- a Bounty Board where shop owner could issue bounties and keep track of its status
an Editor Tool where shop owner could preview and edit a pattern before sending it to a plotter
- I created this prototype to validate important business decisions and to convey the features to 3M's team so we can discuss priority and scope. I utilized this "paper prototype" to probe reactions from potential target customers to validate our hypothesis, and discovered a lot of unexpected learnings.

Pattern Library's Rating: My team spent a lot of energy trying to provide assurance of pattern quality, such as giving it a branded quality seal or compensation for bad patterns. However the yelp-like review was praised by lots of employees, pointing out that they trust other shop owners in the community because people's reputation is on the line.

Real-time Bounty Tracking: This is a page that demonstrate how a shop owner would see real-time update on their pattern requests. We were able to learn that shop owner cared about time, and it’s not to just maximize profit by squeezing more projects into their schedule, what’s more important is to fulfill their promise to their customers, and deliver the service on time.

Embedded Editor Tool: Last, we tested a web pattern customization tool that was highly requested, but would be costly to implement. We asked participants to stack-rank features in terms of priorities, quantified their sentiment on a scale of 5. However, the most powerful evidence we obtained was this quote:

“...so this would be embedded into the UI? And send it straight to the plotter? Well... OK! Yes! I think this would be disruptive just being able to do everything in one setting.”
-- Jake, Shop Owner

Nothing would be as convincing as the quote to demonstrate how much people desire a feature. Having authentic customer sentiment on top of quantified metrics made the conversation with engineers on scope and prioritization much easier.

<Col_2_Section title='To Sum It Up'>
Over 6 weeks, my team and I was able to transform an ambitious and vague concept into a concrete and actionable product plan, with 3 well-defined persona, 1 multi-faced customer journey storyboard and a web platform with 3 major, validated features.

By introducing a customer-focused discovery & validation, I was able to reduce uncertainty, increase team alignment, increase velocity and drive actionable results backed by traceable customer insights.

I was able to replicate this process on a consumer-facing initiative to identify opportunities for film accessory up-sale from forming purchase intents to post-purchase marketing campaign.

I also built out great, trusting relationships with 4 product strategists (3 principles and 1 director), in which I was entrusted with increasing responsibility for product & customer research, and I practiced an intentional approach for design-led product strategy.
